# GPA_Calculater

Design a single page web application to calculate your GPA. In the webpage a user
can enter his/her marks of 4 subjects (marks are always out of 100). When user
enters Calculate GPA button, your program displays the GPA of user using a well designed Alert. If GPA is below 1.8, it is shown using Danger alert. If GPA is in between 1.81 and 2.2, it is shown using Warning alert. If GPA is in-between 2.21
and 3.0, it is shown using Info alert and show it using Success alert otherwise.
Your application should be well designed using bootstrap. Each item should be well
decorated using bootstrap e.g., input fields etc.
Calculate GPA button should be a circular button i.e., round shape button.
